I had trouble keeping all the characters, digressions, refutations, and anticipatory plagiarizations in my head while reading, so I made some diagrams to make the changes clearer. I'm sure I've missed some connections. 

The edition I'm referencing is [this one by Atlas Press](https://atlaspress.co.uk/product/georges-perec-and-the-oulipo-winter-journeys-expanded-edition/). It's out of print now but can be found in the UBC Library (Koerner Stacks).
